    <h1>About This Golf Tee Selector</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This website was created with one simple goal: <strong>to help golfers pick the right set of tees quickly and confidently.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Most golfers either play from tees that are too long, or they spend time debating which box is “correct.” That slows down play, increases frustration, and makes scoring more difficult than it needs to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tool uses three core inputs—your <strong>driver carry distance</strong>, <strong>age</strong>, and <strong>handicap</strong>—to give a balanced, ego-free recommendation for where you’ll enjoy the game the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tee calculator and the accompanying guides on this site are designed to work for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>New golfers learning course setup</li>
        <li>Recreational players who want a fair challenge</li>
        <li>Seniors and juniors adjusting yardage</li>
        <li>Competitive players trying to match course length with ability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This site continues to grow with simple, lightweight tools that help golfers make better decisions on the course. Check out the main tee selector tool here:
