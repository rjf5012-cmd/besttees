    <h1>Complete Golf Tee Selection Guide</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Picking the right set of tees is one of the simplest ways to make golf more fun, improve your scoring potential, and keep pace of play moving. Yet most golfers choose tees based on tradition, ego, or habit—not based on what actually matches their game.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide explains how to choose the right tees based on <strong>driver distance</strong>, <strong>handicap</strong>, <strong>age</strong>, and <strong>course conditions</strong>. It also includes charts, examples, and rules of thumb used by coaches and course rating officials.

    <h2>1. Why Tee Selection Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Golf is most enjoyable when you have a realistic chance of reaching greens in regulation, avoiding overly long par-4s, and keeping pace with the group ahead. Playing from the wrong tees—especially tees that are too far back—makes the game unnecessarily difficult.
    </p>

    <h3>Signs you’re playing tees too long:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You're hitting hybrids or fairway woods into most par 4s.</li>
      <li>Par 3s feel excessively long (180–210 yards).</li>
      <li>You rarely reach par 5s in three shots.</li>
      <li>Your scoring average is noticeably higher than normal.</li>
      <li>Your group consistently falls behind the pace of play.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Choosing the correct tees helps keep the game fun, fair, and faster.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The 36× Driver Distance Rule</h2>
    <p>
      One of the simplest and most accurate methods for tee selection is based on your <strong>driver carry distance</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong><br />
      <em>Driver carry distance × 36 = recommended total course yardage</em>
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Driver carry</th>
          <th>Suggested yardage</th>
          <th>Typical tee box</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>180 yards</td>
          <td>~4,800–5,200 yards</td>
          <td>Forward / Red</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>200 yards</td>
          <td>~5,000–5,400 yards</td>
          <td>Forward / Senior</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>220 yards</td>
          <td>~5,700–6,300 yards</td>
          <td>White / Regular</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>240 yards</td>
          <td>~6,200–6,700 yards</td>
          <td>White / Blue</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>260 yards</td>
          <td>~6,700–7,200 yards</td>
          <td>Blue / Championship</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>3. How Handicap Affects Tee Choice</h2>
    <p>
      Distance determines your <em>maximum</em> possible yardage, but handicap reveals how consistent you are. Two players may both carry the ball 240 yards, but a 3-handicap and a 22-handicap should not play the same tees.
    </p>

    <h3>General guidelines by handicap:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0–5 handicap:</strong> Can play full recommended yardage or slightly longer.</li>
      <li><strong>6–12 handicap:</strong> Play recommended yardage.</li>
      <li><strong>13–20 handicap:</strong> Move up one tee box from recommended yardage.</li>
      <li><strong>20+ handicap:</strong> Forward tees will almost always be more enjoyable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Age-Based Tee Selection</h2>
    <p>
      Swing speed naturally changes with age, affecting distance and ideal course length.
    </p>

    <h3>Typical adjustments:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Juniors (under 18):</strong> Often benefit from moving up one tee box.</li>
      <li><strong>Adults 20–50:</strong> Use primarily distance-based recommendation.</li>
      <li><strong>Seniors (60+):</strong> Often drop one tee box for comfort and pace of play.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Aging golfers should not feel pressure to play “traditional” tees—forward movement improves scoring and enjoyment.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Course Rating, Slope, and Difficulty</h2>
    <p>
      Tee yardage alone doesn’t tell the full story. A 6,300-yard course with a 75.0/145 rating plays much harder than a 6,300-yard course rated 69.8/122.
    </p>

    <h3>Key rating values:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Course Rating:</strong> Difficulty for scratch golfers.</li>
      <li><strong>Slope Rating:</strong> Difficulty for bogey golfers.</li>
      <li><strong>Effective Yardage:</strong> Elevation, wind, turf firmness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your course is known to play “long,” consider moving up from your calculated yardage by ~200–300 yards.
    </p>

    <h2>6. When to Move Up or Down Tees</h2>
    <h3>You should move UP if:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You rarely reach par 4s in two shots.</li>
      <li>You hit hybrids into most par 3s.</li>
      <li>Your group consistently finishes behind pace.</li>
      <li>Your handicap has increased sharply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>You can move DOWN (back) if:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You reach most par 4s with short irons.</li>
      <li>You comfortably carry your driver over 250 yards.</li>
      <li>Your scoring average is stable or improving.</li>
      <li>You want more competitive challenge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Combo Tees and Hybrid Setups</h2>
    <p>
      Many courses now offer “combo tees,” which blend the yardages of two adjacent tee boxes. These are great for players who fall between yardage ranges.
    </p>

    <p>Common combinations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>White/Blue</li>
      <li>Gold/White</li>
      <li>Red/Gold</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If combo tees are available, they often provide the most balanced yardage for mid-handicap golfers.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Example Tee Recommendations</h2>

    <h3>Player A — 180-yard carry, 20 handicap</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommended yardage: ~5,000 yards</li>
      <li>Tee suggestion: Forward / Red</li>
      <li>Reason: Hybrids into long par-4s make the course too difficult.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Player B — 220-yard carry, 12 handicap</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommended yardage: 5,700–6,300 yards</li>
      <li>Tee suggestion: White / Regular</li>
      <li>Reason: Enough distance to hold greens with mid-irons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Player C — 260-yard carry, 4 handicap</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommended yardage: 6,700–7,200 yards</li>
      <li>Tee suggestion: Blue or Championship</li>
      <li>Reason: Short irons into par-4s would make shorter tees too easy.</li>
    </ul>
